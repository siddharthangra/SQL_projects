This project contains the csv data set for the layoff by multiple companies from year 2020-2023.
This project leverages a cleaned dataset to perform a detailed analysis of tech layoffs. By examining variables such as industry, company stage, funding, and geographic location, we aim to uncover patterns and correlations that explain the factors driving these layoffs. The insights gleaned from this analysis will provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the tech industry and the impact of economic and market forces on employment trends.Both options convey the technical nature of the project while maintaining a clear and concise tone. They highlight the key variables and the goal of uncovering insights from the data analysis.
The dataset indicates a correlation between the COVID-19 pandemic and increased layoffs. While the IT industry experienced a surge during this time, particularly in emerging markets like India, developed economies, such as the United States, witnessed more substantial job cuts.
